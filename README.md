## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a suspected suspicious looking phishing email which contained an unknown attachment.

## Steps:

## Step 1:
I began by opening the .eml file in Outlook to begin the investigation.

## Step 2:
In this step, I focused on the source of the email, the subject and the recipient.

## Step 3:
To get a better understanding of the email - I dragged the .eml file into a text editor to get more information about the file, such as its source IP.

## Step 4: 
After confirming the source IP, I then preformed a reverse DNS lookup using Domain Tools. I then was able to find the resolved host.

## Step 5: 
I then focused on the link that was attached in the phishing email - here I used a website called URL2PNG which allowed me to view a screenshot of the malicious link.

## Step 6:
In this next step I was able to see what service the webpage was hosted on.
